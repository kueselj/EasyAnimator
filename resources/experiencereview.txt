To settle on using keyframes from the beginning would have vastly simplified our experience.
Though in the end we did make the switch, even internally in our model implementation,
motions were a significant pain-point in assignment 6.
Our expectations of exact behavior were slightly different than instructors,
and so reading files mysteriously became undoable.
Switching to keyframes early would have smoothed over the specific issue we encountered.

One other design choice we began to regret was not separating shape type from shape state.
When adding a shape to model, clients had to go through creating a default set of properties.
This didn't have a clear interpretation of use when thinking about state through motions.
