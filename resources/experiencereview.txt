DESIGN REFLECTION
=================

To settle on using keyframes from the beginning would have vastly simplified our experience.
Though in the end we did make the switch, even internally in our model implementation,
motions were a significant pain-point in assignment 6.
Our expectations of exact behavior were slightly different than instructors,
and so reading files mysteriously became undoable.
Switching to keyframes early would have smoothed over the specific issue we encountered.

One other design choice we began to regret was not separating shape type from shape state.
When adding a shape to model, clients had to go through creating a default set of properties.
This didn't have a clear interpretation of use when thinking about state through motions.

EXPERIENCE WITH PROVIDERS
==========================

Our experience with our providers was pretty good. Unfortunately they didn't finish assignment
7 so we were unable to implement a lot of the features we would have liked such as working with
the full functionality of an editor view. We did get to work with playback controls, however. They
originally didn't send us all the files we needed but after a quick email they gave us all the
correct files and were very nice about it.

To be honest, we were a little taken aback by some of their design choices which made understanding
what we could do a little difficult at first. However, we eventually figured it out and decided
that some components needed to be suppressed in order to ensure functionality.

Overall our providers were very nice and helped us by answering all of the questions that we had
about their design.
