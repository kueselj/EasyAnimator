This document appends the text definition first described in assignment 5 (with a small change in
assignment 6 which added canvases) with layers and rotations.

To define a named layer (and this must be done before it's used), users should create a line like:

layer [name] [visibility]

Where layer specifies adding a layer, and [name] can be replaced with the layer name,
and [visibility] is a boolean value of if the layer is visible or not.

To add shapes to a layer, shape definitions can now read (as an example).

shape R rectangle name

Where name is the name of the layer to add the shape to.
Shapes with the same name, but across different layers are NOT allowed for backwards compatibility
reasons.

If shape definitions do not have a layer, they are added to a base layer which will sit
at the bottom of the scene.

Every layer will have the same canvas size and offset, though this was not necessary.
This is to simplify input.

To add rotation to a shape, motion definitions may include an extra two columns.
They would read like:

#        t  x   y   w  h   r   g  b  ROT    t   x   y   w  h   r   g  b ROT
motion R 1  200 200 50 100 255 0  0  25     10  200 200 50 100 255 0  0 25

Where ROT is the degrees counterclockwise the shape should be rotated.
If the line is missing these two extra columns, then a default rotation of zero is taken.

Keyframes are just one half of the column above.
